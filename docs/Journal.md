# Week 1

- Added `Vector3D` class
- Wrote header file for `Vector3D`
- Wrote `Vector3D` documentation
- Wrote standardized tests template
- Wrote tests for `Vector3D`
- Made `constants.h` file
- Setup compilation and `Makefile`

# Week 2

- `Makefile` template done
- Change order of `const double` to `double const`
- Use `v.getX()` in class functions instead of `v.x()`
- Change `Vector3D` (tests) to `testVector3D`
- Change `Vector3D` constructor to a default constructor

# Week 3

- Change constants to `inline` according to the C++17 norm

# Todo

- Add large scale error management -> custom `Exception` sub-classes
- Answer questions week 3
- Check `Vector3D` class overloading for optimization
- Move `Vector3D `overloading from `__method__` directly to the operator
- Rename `stringify` to `to_string` to comply to the C++ norm
- Test performance of `+=` operator return type (`void` vs `Vector3D&`)
- Test performance of storing coordinates as doubles or an array
- Creation of a class `Particule`
- Creation of tests `Particule`
